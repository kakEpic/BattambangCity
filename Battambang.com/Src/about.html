            Battambang (Khmer: បាត់ដំបង, Bătdâmbâng [ɓatɗɑmɓɑːŋ], lit. 'The Lost Stick') is a province of Cambodia in the far northwest of the country. Bordering provinces are Banteay Meanchey to the north, Pursat to the east and south, Siem Reap to the northeast, and Pailin to
             the west. The northern and southern extremes of the province's western boundaries form part of the international border with Thailand. In addition, Tonlé Sap forms part of the northeastern boundary between Siem Reap and Pursat. Its capital and largest city is Battambang.
            It is the fifth most populous province in Cambodia.[1] In land area, Battambang is the fifth largest province of C
            ambodia. Battambang is one of the provinces included in the Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve.[2] The province's fertile rice fields
            have led to a mostly agricultural economy giving rise to the moniker "the rice bowl of Cambodia". The province features a range of cultures as well as
            natural resources. Seventy five percent of the area is jungles and mountains. The area has a tropical climate.

            Wat Banan (Khmer: ភ្នំបាណន់), some 25 km south of Battambang city, has been likened to a smaller version of the more imposing Angkor Wat. The 11th century Angkorian 
            mountain ruin of Phnom Banan is one of the best preserved Angkorian Khmer temples around Battambang province. As you approach you will see the distance five tower pointing skyward, Like a small 
            version of Angkor Wat. At the base of 
            the mountain you can faced with a step laterite staircase flanked by nagas. After climbing the 350+ steps you are treated to a wonderfully peaceful setting.
