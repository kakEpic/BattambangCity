                        Battambang town is at the heart of Cambodia's 'rice bowl', and even though it is the
                        country's second biggest town, it still has a very local, untouristed, provincial atmosphere.
                        Much of the architecture is French colonial and traditional Cambodian. Few buildings are over
                        three stories, and the main streets are shared by cars and horse carts alike. Unlike more touristed
                        towns, the local economy is truly local-based firmly in rice, wood, sapphires and food crops - and is reflected
                        in the character of the town. Similarly, as you leave Battambang by road, the scene quickly becomes one of small
                        villages, rice paddies, and farmland, offering an excellent opportunity for
                        the visitor to see a bit of 'unspoiled rural Cambodia.

                        Battambang was established as an important trading city with around 2,500 residents in the 18th century. The population was 
                        centred along a single road parallel to the Sangkae River (Stung Sangkae). In 1795 Siam (modern-day Thailand) annexed much of 
                        north western Cambodia including the current provinces of Banteay Meanchey, Battambang, Oddar Meanchey, Pailin, and Siem Reap 
                        into the province of Inner Cambodia. The Siamese ruled Battambang as a provincial capital through the Thai-speaking Khmer Abhaiwongse 
                        family,[4] a branch of the Khmer royal family, which governed for six generations until 1907 when the province was ceded to the French 
                        to be reunited with Cambodia as part of the French Indochina colony.
